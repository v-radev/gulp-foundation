# gulp-foundation
Starter gulp project with basic tasks for JS compilation per page (each page has a separate JS file, e.g. source/js/home.js), CSS and image minification. Other inluded tasks are watcher and browser sync. To make your own tasks add a JS file in tasks/ folder and enable it in library/enabledTasks.js. Run gulp with flag '--env=production' to minify the CSS and JS.
